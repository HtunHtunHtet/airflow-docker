# Challenges and Considerations for Our Pipeline Implementation

## What I Discovered During the Spike

After working with Airflow for the past few days and building our POC, here are the main challenges and considerations I think we'll face when implementing our product description pipeline.

## Issues I Ran Into

### XCom Data Size Limitations
While building the POC, I noticed that XCom is really meant for small pieces of data. When I tried passing larger product data objects between tasks, I realized this could become a bottleneck. For our product description pipeline, we'll likely need to:
- Store larger datasets in our database or S3
- Pass just IDs or file paths through XCom
- Keep the actual product data in external storage

### Resource Usage
During my testing, I had to remove the airflow-worker container because it was consuming too much CPU. This made me think about how resource-intensive our description generation tasks might be. We'll probably need:
- Dedicated worker nodes for ML/AI tasks
- Better resource allocation strategies
- Maybe look into Kubernetes executor for auto-scaling

### Dependency on External Services
Our pipeline will depend heavily on our product database, ML models, and possibly external APIs. During testing, I saw how failures cascade through the pipeline. We need to think about:
- What happens when our ML service is down?
- How do we handle database connection issues?
- Should we have fallback mechanisms for critical failures?

## Things That Worked Well But Need Consideration

### Error Handling
The retry mechanism worked great in my tests, but I can see how it might not be enough for production. Some tasks might need different retry strategies - quick retries for network issues, longer delays for resource constraints.

### Scheduling
I started with daily scheduling but quickly switched to manual triggers for testing. For production, we'll need to figure out:
- How often should we generate descriptions?
- Do we process in batches or individual products?
- How do we handle backfill if the system is down?

## Development Workflow Concerns

### Team Onboarding
Setting up the local environment took some trial and error. I had to figure out the Docker configuration, deal with the init container issues, and switch executors. New team members will need:
- Clear setup documentation (which I've started)
- Understanding of Airflow concepts
- Local development best practices

### Code Organization
As I built more DAGs, I noticed code duplication. We'll want to:
- Create shared utility functions
- Establish coding standards
- Figure out how to test our DAGs properly

### Deployment Process
Right now, I'm just editing files directly in the dags folder. For production, we need:
- Proper CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Safe deployment practices

## Production Readiness Gaps

### Monitoring
The Airflow UI is helpful for development, but for production we'll need:
- Alerts when DAGs fail
- Performance monitoring
- Data quality checks
- Integration with our existing monitoring tools

### High Availability
My local setup is single-node. Production considerations:
- What happens if the scheduler goes down?
- Database backup and recovery
- Load balancing for the web interface

## Specific to Our Use Case

### Data Volume
Our product catalog is growing. Questions I have:
- How many products can we process in parallel?
- What's the optimal batch size?
- How do we handle peak loads?

### Integration Points
We'll need to connect with:
- Our existing product database
- ML model serving infrastructure
- Content management system
- Possibly external data sources

### Quality Control
For generated descriptions, we need:
- Validation that descriptions were actually generated
- Quality checks on the content
- Rollback mechanisms for bad generations
- A/B testing capabilities
